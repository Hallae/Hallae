Hello! I'm Keifer, an enthusiastic learner and developer with a keen interest in expanding my knowledge and skills in C#, ASP.NET Core, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm always on the lookout for interesting projects to collaborate on, and I'm excited about the potential to contribute and learn from these experiences.

Feel free to reach out to me via Telegram at @nenggcrozby or check out my projects on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/users/Hallae/projects. I'm eager to connect and discuss potential collaborations or opportunities to grow together in the tech community.
