Hello! I'm Keifer, an enthusiastic learner and developer with a keen interest in expanding my knowledge and skills in C#, ASP.NET Core I'm always on the lookout for interesting projects to collaborate on, and I'm excited about the potential to contribute and learn from these experiences.


I'm eager to connect and discuss potential collaborations or opportunities to grow together in the tech community.

Feel free to reach out to me via Telegram at @nenggcrozby and check out my first few projects on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/users/Hallae/projects.
